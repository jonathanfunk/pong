Pong
======

## Project
The objective for this project is to recreate an old arcade game using HTML5 Canvas.

## Technology
* Atom Text Editor
* Webpack
* HTML5 Canvas
* ES2015 Javascript
* Command Line Interface
* Git/Github

## Learning Experience
This project involved a lot of Javascript. Before I got started on this project, I got Webpack working which allowed me to bundle my javascript files and to stream any saved changes to my browser, just like Gulp's browser sync. I like what I see and would like to explore more.

I developed Pong using ES2015 Javascript practices and HTML5 Canvas. This project was a bit tricky and it made me think on how to set this up logically. In the end, I came up with a functional Pong game.
